## Snyder Lab

Code to help process data for work at Snyder Lab (Stanford University Department of Genetics):
- `reformat_columns.py` parses column names into the proper format needed
- `bile-acids-bacteria-cor.R` does an inner join on two data frames and calculates correlations of the numeric values in the resulting matrix
